                        Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal
                        developer of
                        the
                        Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version
                        control
                        system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer
                        science
                        at
                        the University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991.
                        Since
                        then,
                        the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world, powering
                        everything
                        from
                        smartphones to supercomputers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio">
                        Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni), a six-time Finnish national karate champion,
                        whom
                        he
                        met in late 1993. He was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and
                        instructed
                        the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail
                        asking
                        for
                        a date.[8] They were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in the United
                        States.[51] The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in
                        hexadecimal)
                        as magic values.

                    <p class="bio">
                        Torvalds has described himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding, "I find that people
                        seem
                        to
                        think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both.
                        It
                        gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is
                        seen to
                        be
                        something miraculous.
